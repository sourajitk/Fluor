# What is Fluor ?
**Fluor** is a tool that allows you to automatically change the behavior of the keyboard's fn keys depending on the active application. It's that simple.

# Instaling Fluor
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sourajitk/Fluor/releases), open the ZIP and drag the application to your `/Applications` folder.

You can also build it from source, but this is not recommended if your are only going to use **Fluor** in the regular way, and not hack it. 

# How does it work?
If you're here, you know how this works (:

# Why is it open source ?
I made **Fluor** because I needed such an application. I wanted it simple, nicely designed and free and I didn't find such a thing on the internet. Once it was done I used it for a little while, cleaned up the code and decided to give it to others for free. What was a requirement for me can well be a requirement for others too.  
You'd argue that such a non-sandboxed app had no chance to hit the AppStore and you'd be right. But if I had the chance it would have remained free and open-source. I don't think there's many people needing such an app and I prefer seeing it used by a wider range of people.  

This app is also built using open-source code, that's why I think it belongs to this world. And if someone learns something looking at the code I'll be happy ðŸ˜ƒ.
